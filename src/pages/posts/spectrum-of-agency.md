# Spectrum of Agency

## Definition

**Spectrum of Agency** is a framework for understanding the different ways that entities can exercise power, influence, and autonomy within complex systems. It recognizes agency as existing along multiple dimensions rather than as a binary property, acknowledging that the capacity to act effectively varies across contexts, constraints, and forms of expression.

## Key Dimensions

### Scope of Influence
- **Micro Agency**: Ability to affect immediate personal circumstances
- **Meso Agency**: Capacity to influence group dynamics and local systems
- **Macro Agency**: Power to shape broader social, economic, or political structures

### Mode of Expression
- **Direct Agency**: Explicit action with intentional outcomes
- **Indirect Agency**: Creating conditions that enable or constrain others' actions
- **Distributed Agency**: Action emerging from collective or networked processes

### Temporal Orientation
- **Reactive Agency**: Responding to immediate stimuli or challenges
- **Strategic Agency**: Planning and acting toward medium-term objectives
- **Generative Agency**: Creating conditions for long-term emergent possibilities

### Constraint Navigation
- **Compliant Agency**: Working within established rules and structures
- **Adaptive Agency**: Finding creative pathways within constraints
- **Transformative Agency**: Changing the rules and structures themselves

## Agency in Different Domains

### Individual Agency
- **Psychological Factors**: How identity, belief systems, and mental models shape perceived agency
- **Embodied Agency**: The role of physical capabilities and limitations
- **Social Positioning**: How factors like class, race, gender affect agency expression

### Collective Agency
- **Coordination Mechanisms**: How groups align action toward shared goals
- **Emergent Patterns**: How individual actions create unintended collective effects
- **Institutional Forms**: How organizational structures enable or constrain group agency

### Technological Agency
- **Tool Extension**: How technologies amplify human capabilities
- **Algorithmic Agency**: How automated systems make consequential decisions
- **Human-Machine Collaboration**: How agency emerges in hybrid systems

### Non-Human Agency
- **Material Agency**: How physical properties and processes shape possibilities
- **Ecological Agency**: How living systems maintain integrity and adapt
- **Conceptual Agency**: How ideas and concepts shape thought and action

## Analytical Framework

### Agency Assessment Dimensions
- **Intentionality**: Degree to which actions reflect conscious aims vs. unconscious patterns
- **Efficacy**: Ability to achieve desired outcomes
- **Awareness**: Understanding of constraints and possibilities
- **Adaptability**: Capacity to modify approach based on changing conditions
- **Resistance**: Ability to counter opposing forces

### Agency Development Processes
- **Agency Acquisition**: How actors gain new forms or degrees of agency
- **Agency Transfer**: How agency shifts between actors or systems
- **Agency Amplification**: How agency expands through leverage points
- **Agency Suppression**: How agency becomes restricted or limited

## Applied Contexts

### Educational Settings
- **Learner Agency**: Fostering student autonomy and self-direction
- **Teacher Agency**: Navigating institutional constraints while enabling change
- **System Agency**: How educational structures enable or limit transformation

### Political Systems
- **Citizen Agency**: Forms of democratic participation and civic action
- **Institutional Agency**: How governmental structures exercise power
- **Movement Agency**: How collective action creates political change

### Design and Innovation
- **Designer Agency**: Balancing creative vision with user needs
- **User Agency**: How people adapt and repurpose designed systems
- **Participatory Design**: Distributing agency across stakeholder networks

## Theoretical Foundations

The Spectrum of Agency framework draws on multiple theoretical traditions:

- **Structuration Theory** (Giddens): The recursive relationship between human action and social structures
- **Actor-Network Theory** (Latour): Distribution of agency across human and non-human actors
- **Capabilities Approach** (Sen): Agency as the freedom to achieve valued functionings
- **Complex Adaptive Systems**: Agency emerging through self-organization and feedback loops
- **Feminist and Postcolonial Theory**: Contextual and intersectional nature of agency

## Implications and Applications

### For Research
- Moving beyond binary conceptions of agency/structure
- Developing nuanced methods for agency assessment
- Examining agency across scales and systems

### For Practice
- Designing interventions that recognize and enhance diverse forms of agency
- Identifying leverage points for agency development
- Creating conditions for distributed and collective agency

### For Policy
- Recognizing structural factors that enable or constrain agency
- Developing frameworks that distribute agency more equitably
- Evaluating policy impact on different dimensions of agency

## Conclusion

The Spectrum of Agency offers a multidimensional framework for understanding how different entities navigate complex systems. By recognizing agency as variable across contexts, expressions, and constraints, this approach avoids both overstating individual autonomy and understating the capacity for meaningful action within structures. This nuanced perspective enables more effective analysis and intervention in complex social, technological, and ecological systems.

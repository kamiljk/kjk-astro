# Sample Markdown Post

This is a sample markdown file that will be displayed in our card grid. When you create more markdown files in this directory, they'll automatically appear in the grid on the homepage.

## Features

- Automatic card generation from markdown files
- Clean and responsive design
- Sidebar navigation

Feel free to add more markdown files to see how they populate the grid!

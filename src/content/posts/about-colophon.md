This site represents an exploration of modern web development techniques with an emphasis on performance and maintainability.

Built with Astro as the core framework - chosen for its island architecture that enables rich interactivity with minimal JavaScript. Styled using Tailwind CSS for consistent design language across components.

Content is authored in Markdown with YAML frontmatter, enabling separation of content and presentation concerns.

The interactive game components showcase canvas-based rendering techniques - Electro-Ball leverages the p5.js library for particle physics, while Bad Ghost uses vanilla JavaScript for retro-style gameplay.

Typography emphasizes readability with system fonts for body text and specialized fonts for code and game elements.

This project is heavily inspired by the principles of **digital gardening**, as popularized by **[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)**. The site is designed as a "living" knowledge base, blending personal exploration with public-facing content. It also draws influence from **[Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/)**, particularly his approach to long-form, interconnected writing and knowledge management.

Additional inspiration comes from:
- **[Non-Technical Gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening)** and **[A Brief History of Digital Gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)** by Maggie Appleton.
- **[The Garden and the Stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)** by Mike Caulfield.
- **[Mind Gardens](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)** by Anne-Laure Le Cunff.
- **[r/DigitalGardens](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/)**: A community exploring digital gardening concepts.
- **[Tiago Forte](https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoForte)**: For his work on personal knowledge management and the "Second Brain" methodology.

Deployed through a continuous integration pipeline via GitHub Actions to Vercel's edge network for optimal global performance.

# ðŸš§ Under Construction

This site is a living, evolving projectâ€”part portfolio, part digital garden, and part
experimental playground. Inspired by the principles of digital gardening, as described in
the [Colophon](/posts/about-colophon), the site is designed to grow organically, with
ideas and content continuously refined, reorganized, and expanded.

## What to Expect

- **Ongoing Redesign:** The structure, navigation, and visual style are in flux as I
  experiment with new layouts and interactive elements.
- **Content in Progress:** Many pages are drafts, notes, or seeds for future writing.
  Some concepts are fully developed, while others are sketches or references for further
  exploration.
- **Interconnected Knowledge:** Posts are linked through shared concepts,
  cross-references, and thematic clusters, reflecting a non-linear, rhizomatic approach
  to knowledge (see [Rhizome](/posts/rhizome)).
- **Interactive Experiments:** Youâ€™ll find playable prototypes, visualizations, and
  games (like [Flow Face](/posts/flow-face) and [Thinking Triangles](/posts/thinking-triangles)),
  each exploring new ways to engage with ideas.

## Philosophy

This project is guided by a pattern of **consume â†’ curate â†’ create**. Rather than
simply collecting information, I aim to actively curate and synthesize ideas, then
create new work that contributes back to the ecosystem. This recursive process mirrors
  the site's structure: content is not static, but always in a state of becoming (see
  [Nested Becoming](/posts/nested-becoming)).

## Thank You

Thank you for your patience as I experiment and refine the experience. If youâ€™re
curious about the technical details or inspirations behind the site, check out the
[Colophon](/posts/about-colophon). Your visit and curiosity help shape this ongoing
experiment!

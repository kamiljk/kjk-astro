**Definition:**  
Systems of thought, communication, and expression that shape and are shaped by social structures, power relations, and knowledge production.

---

## Definition

**Discourse** is not simply language or text, but a *system of thought, knowledge, and power* that determines what can be said, thought, or perceived as truth within specific historical and social contexts. It operates in liminal spaces between power and resistance, knowledge and ignorance, subject and object—simultaneously constructing reality while concealing its own constructedness.

---

## Liminal Modality

Discourse functions precisely at **threshold zones** where:

- **Sayable ↔ Unsayable**: Defining boundaries of legitimate speech and thought
- **Visible ↔ Invisible**: Determining what can be perceived or recognized
- **Subject ↔ Object**: Constituting both speaking subjects and objects of knowledge
- **Power ↔ Resistance**: Creating the conditions for both control and subversion

These boundary operations make discourse inherently liminal—always working at the edges of established knowledge systems.

---

## Key Attributes

### ◎ **Power-Knowledge Nexus**

Discourse both produces and is produced by power relations, creating regimes of truth that determine what is considered legitimate knowledge. Power operates not just as repression but as productive force through discourse.

> *"Power produces reality; it produces domains of objects and rituals of truth."* — Foucault

### ⌛ **Historical Contingency**

Discursive formations are not universal but emerge from specific historical and cultural contexts, often shifting dramatically across different epistemes (historical knowledge systems).

### ⛓️ **Institutional Reinforcement**

Discourses are maintained through institutions (medical, legal, educational, media) that validate certain statements while excluding others. These institutions regulate who can speak with authority and on what topics.

### ⟲ **Subject Formation**

Discourse doesn't simply express pre-existing subjects but actively constitutes them, creating subject positions from which individuals can speak and be recognized.

### ⊖ **Exclusionary Practices**

Every discourse operates through rules of exclusion determining what cannot be said, who cannot speak, and which statements are rejected as false, dangerous, or meaningless.

---

## Discursive Structures & Mechanisms

### **Discursive Formations**

Patterns and rules governing what statements can emerge within a particular knowledge domain.

Key elements include:

- **Objects**: What can be spoken about
- **Enunciative Modalities**: Who can speak with authority
- **Concepts**: How ideas can be organized and related
- **Strategies**: How knowledge can be deployed for various purposes

### **Statement Function**

The statement (*énoncé*) as fundamental unit of discourse operates not through meaning but function—how it relates to other statements, institutions, and practices.

### **Archives**

The system defining the emergence and transformation of statements, functioning as the "law of what can be said" within a given period.

### **Discursive Practices**

Activities that systematically form the objects they speak about, not merely representing but actively producing reality.

---

## Threshold Dynamics

Discourse operates through critical threshold operations:

1. **Rarefaction**  
   Mechanisms that limit who can speak and what can be said:
   - Commentary (privileging certain "primary" texts)
   - Author function (attributing unity and authority)
   - Disciplines (defining methodological boundaries)

2. **Discontinuity**  
   Points where discursive shifts create ruptures in knowledge systems:
   - Epistemic breaks (fundamental reorganizations of knowledge)
   - Paradigm shifts (reorientations of scientific understanding)
   - Discursive transformations (changes in what counts as evidence)

3. **Materialization**  
   How discourse becomes embedded in:
   - Bodies (through disciplinary practices)
   - Architecture (through spatial arrangements)
   - Technologies (through design and implementation)
   - Institutions (through policies and procedures)

---

## Types of Discourse Analysis

Different approaches to analyzing discursive formations:

### **Archaeology**

Examines the historical conditions making certain statements possible, focusing on rules governing discursive practices rather than meanings or intentions.

### **Genealogy**

Traces how discourses emerge from power relations and historical contingencies, rejecting notions of inevitable progress or origin.

### **Critical Discourse Analysis**

Analyzes how social power, dominance, and inequality are reproduced through text and talk in social and political contexts.

### **Performative Analysis**

Explores how discourse doesn't just describe but performs social actions, bringing realities into being through speech acts.

---

## Discourse in Liminal Spaces

Discourse has special properties in liminal zones:

### **Contested Terrains**

Areas where multiple discourses compete for legitimacy:

- Scientific controversies
- Emergent technologies
- Social movements
- Cultural boundaries

### **Discursive Hybridity**

Zones where discourses mix and transform:

- Interdisciplinary spaces
- Cultural contact zones
- Translation contexts
- Digital/physical interfaces

### **Silences & Gaps**

Where discourse reveals its limits:

- Taboo subjects
- Traumatic experiences
- Ineffable phenomena
- Structural exclusions

---

## Applications & Analytical Utility

### **Institutional Analysis**

Examining how organizations establish and maintain regimes of truth through:

- Mission statements and policies
- Classification systems
- Standard operating procedures
- Evaluation criteria

### **Media Studies**

Analyzing how public discourse is shaped through:

- Framing techniques
- Source selection
- Narrative conventions
- Visual rhetoric

### **Policy Analysis**

Understanding how issues are constituted through:

- Problem definitions
- Causal narratives
- Target population constructions
- Solution frameworks

### **Identity Politics**

Exploring how subjectivities are formed through:

- Naming practices
- Categorization systems
- Recognition policies
- Resistance narratives

---

## Discourse and Resistance

Points where discourse creates possibilities for resistance:

### **Counter-Discourse**

Alternative knowledge systems that challenge dominant narratives:

- Indigenous knowledge traditions
- Feminist epistemologies
- Subaltern historiographies
- Queer theory

### **Discursive Tactics**

Strategic interventions within dominant discourses:

- Appropriation and recontextualization
- Parody and subversion
- Strategic silence
- Rhetorical jujitsu

### **Discursive Ruptures**

Moments where established discourses break down:

- Crisis events
- Paradigm collapses
- Revolutionary periods
- Technological disruptions

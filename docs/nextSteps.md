# Next Steps for Architectural Alignment

This document outlines the specific tasks needed to align the current site implementation with the architectural principles and patterns defined in the `siteArchitecture.md` source of truth.

## Completed

- **Reorganize component directory structure**
- **Update imports across the project**
- **Update NavbarMenu.jsx client directive**
- **Update Feed.jsx client directive**
- **Review all other React components for client directives**
- **Move inline styles from Feed.jsx to CSS Module**
- **Create CSS Module for NavbarMenu.jsx**
- **Update global CSS variables**
- **Review and update media queries**
- **Test NavbarMenu on mobile devices**
- **Optimize Feed layout across viewports**
- **Create or update Playwright tests**
- **Implement Utopia fluid scaling for type and space**
- **Adopt design tokens and CSS variables everywhere**
- **Implement font-face and theme system**
- **Add parallax dot grid background**
- **Standardize Astro Content Collections usage**
- **Add View Transitions**
  - Implement smooth transitions between pages
  - Focus on post listing to detail page transitions

## Pending

- **Implement Astro Image integration**
  - Optimize post thumbnails and other images
  - Add appropriate loading strategies (eager/lazy based on fold position)
- **Lighthouse performance testing**
  - Run Lighthouse tests on key pages
  - Optimize based on results to meet performance targets in architecture guide
- **Create performance test scripts**
  - Implement custom performance monitoring
  - Track JavaScript size and hydration timing
- **Update code comments**
  - Add references to architectural patterns where appropriate
  - Document client directive choices in components
- **Create component guide**
  - Document available components and their intended use
  - Include examples of proper implementation

## Timeline

**Phase 1 (Immediate - 1-2 weeks):**
- Component reorganization
- Client directive updates
- CSS Module implementation

**Phase 2 (2-4 weeks):**
- Performance optimization
- Responsive design enhancements
- Testing implementation

**Phase 3 (Ongoing):**
- Documentation
- Continuous performance monitoring and optimization

## Measuring Success

Success will be measured against the following metrics:
1. **Performance Scores**: Lighthouse metrics meet targets specified in architecture guide
2. **Code Organization**: Components are properly organized by type (static vs. interactive)
3. **Test Coverage**: Architecture compliance tests pass
4. **Developer Experience**: New components added follow the architectural patterns automatically

Regular reviews should be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with the architectural principles defined in the source of truth.
